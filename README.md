# Le-Chapeau++
(aka Hat)

https://pkcody.github.io/Le-Chapeau/

A multiplayer game using Unity and Photon. A chance to learn setting up lobby's for player to join before the game as well as Unity's UI to create a network menu and in-game UI.

I added the concept of Arsene Lupin addeptation with objective being to be the true Lupin. Using primitve shapes to make the character and adjusting code and UI to inform the players who is it.
