# Le-Chapeau++
(aka Hat)

https://pkcody.github.io/Le-Chapeau/

A multiplayer game using Unity and Photon. A chance to learn setting up lobbies for players to join before the game as well as Unity's UI to create a network menu and in-game UI.

I added the concept of Arsene Lupin adaptation with the objective being to be the true Lupin. I used primitive shapes to make the character, adjusting code, and added UI to inform the players who is Lupin.
